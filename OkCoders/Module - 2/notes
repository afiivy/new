DOM is built by the browser. We can create a new element to add to the DOM if needed.
Persistant- if we are storing the infomation on a server somewhere to recall later.
To call from the html- better to use an ID to be specific and not cause a bug and not call another element or class you don't want. 
innerText- shows readable text and contnet text shows the script and everything else
Qoutes are interchangable but if you open with a single quote should close with a single qoute. Use the opposite qoutes with you want them to show. You can use backslash to escape. 
arr.push- adds an item to the list
arr.pop - removes from the list
arr.length-  number of contnet
arr.shift and arr.unshift take up more memory

Escaping Characters
"The man whispered, \"please speak to me.\""
Special characters
Quotes aren’t the only special characters that need to be escaped, there’s actually quite a few(opens in a new tab). However, to keep it simple, here’s a list of some common special characters in JavaScript.

Code	Character
\\	\ (backslash)
"	'' (double quote)
'	' (single quote)
\n	newline
\t	tab
The last two characters listed in the table, newline \n and tab \t, are unique because they add additional whitespace to your Strings. A newline character will add a line break and a tab character will advance your line to the next tab stop(opens in a new tab).

"Up up\n\tdown down"
Returns:
Up up
 down down
highlight text and then ctrl+forward slash to hide in html
// forward slash for JavaScript
